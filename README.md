# birthday_greeter

## Action Plan
In order to test my understanding of web apps and verify that I can build a simple web app with a form using an MVC framework, I will build a birthday greeter app.

## Project Plan  
This app will include:  
- A form for the user to input their name and birthday  
- A message that wishes the user happy birthday  
- A message telling the user how long they'd have to wait until their birthday  

As an extra, I will aim to add style to the content so it looks pretty.
